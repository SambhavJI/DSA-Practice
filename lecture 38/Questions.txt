Letter combinations of a phone number :-
In a phone keypad there are number which are assosiated with alphabets eg 2 -> abc etc. Now we have to find all possible combnation entitled to a number eg 23 -> abc and def so possible combinations are {ad,ae,af,bd,be,bf,cd,ce,cf}.
First we will map the alphabets corresponding to number using maps. Then we will take the ndex 1 determine which element is there and make the cases for each alphabets corresponding to the number similarly in the next step we will increase the index by 1 and then add all the elements of the number at that index to the number at the previous index.
we will use recursion where the base case will be when we go past the length of the string.
This C++ code generates all possible letter combinations that a given digit string (composed of digits 2â€“9) could represent on a phone keypad. It uses a recursive backtracking approach where the solve function builds combinations by appending each possible letter mapped from the current digit and recursively processing the next digit. When the end of the digit string is reached (index >= digits.size()), the current combination (output) is added to the result list. Backtracking is done by removing the last character after each recursive call to explore other possibilities. The letterCombinations function initializes the process by checking for empty input and setting up the digit-to-letter mapping array (similar to a phone keypad), and the main function handles user input/output for demonstration.
