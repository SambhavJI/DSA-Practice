Pivot- A pivot in an array is the point where the sum of the left of the array is equal to the sum of the right elemnts in an array.
*Search in a rotated sorted array:-
In this problem we need to find if an element is presentin a array but that sorted array is rotated by some elemnts.
eg. arr={1,2,3,7,8} after rotation it becomes {7,8,1,2,3} lets say we need to find two in here.
The aproach is that we will have two lines one of 7 and 8 and one of 1,2,3 so we will first find the pivot element.
After finding the pivot element we will compare the key through pivot index to check if it exist between 7,8 or in 1,2,3 
and then apply binary search in that region.
*Square root by binary search:-
To find a square root of a number by binary search we first take an array from 0 to that number than calculate its mid if the square of mid is greater than 
number we will take end to mid-1 as it is a sorted array so all elements grater than mid will also be greater than number now if the mid is less
than the number we will store the value of mid as it is a possible answer then upgrade the start to mid+1 and if mid=number than return mid.
This approach only tells us about the integer part of the code. and ifthe value of mid is too large it will throw an error during square calculation so we 
will use long long int instead.
To calculate the fractional part use brute force- where you add 0.1 to the above answer and then square it to check if it is less then number then put in the
answer variable then again add 0.1 till the square will be greater than the number. 
If more precise soln is needed then add 0.01.
